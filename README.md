Frappe interpreter in Haskell was written as an assignment for JPP (Languages and Paradigms of Programming) class on MIMUW (Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw).

Frappe is a language based on Latte with modified syntax in function and variable declaration. It also offers a bunch of additional features:

1. Built-in print instruction.
2. Passing arguments as variables (using "x: @int" syntax).
3. Static type-checking.
4. Helpful runtime errors.
5. Nested function definitions with static binding.
6. Anonymous functions, functions as arguments and return values. JavaScript-like closures.
