Frappe is a language based on Latte, changing function and variable declarations 
and adding a bunch of features.

1. Built-in print instruction.
2. Passing arguments as variables (using "x: @int" syntax).
3. Variable shadowing with static binding.
4. Static type-checking.
5. Helpful runtime errors.
6. Nested function definitions.
7. Anonymous functions, functions as arguments and return values. JavaScript-like closures.
8. Mulitdimensional arrays, which are passed to functions by pointer (Java-like).
